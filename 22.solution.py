# Here's a possible solution to the assignment:


# Create a list of top 5 favorite books
favorite_books = ['To Kill a Mockingbird', 'The Great Gatsby', '1984', 'The Catcher in the Rye', 'Brave New World']

# Print the original list of favorite books
print("Original list of favorite books:", favorite_books)

# Reverse the order of the list in place
favorite_books.reverse()

# Print the reversed list of favorite books
print("Reversed list of favorite books:", favorite_books)

# This code creates a list of favorite books, prints the original list, reverses the order of the list using the reverse()
# method in place, and prints the reversed list. Note that we use the same variable favorite_books to store the reversed list,
# so that we don't create a new reversed list.
